# Setups - Currently considering resnet-34 and fixed learning regime
==========================================

1. Train a basic Unet from scratch - DONE

2. Train a basic Unet using pre-trained 'imagenet' weights - DONE

3. Train Unet in Two Steps (V1):
    A. Train the encoder with a classification head on gender - keep encoder weights - DONE
    B Train a basic Unet using pre-trained encoder_cls weights - DONE

3. Train Unet in Two Steps (V2):
    A. Train the encoder with a multi-task classification head on gender and age  - keep encoder weights
    B Train a basic Unet using pre-trained encoder_cls weights - DONE

4. Train Unet and Classification Combined (V1):
    Train segmentation and classification together  - from scratch - DONE

5. Train Unet and Classification Combined (V2):
    Train segmentation and classification together - using encoder weights from 3 (A or B)
